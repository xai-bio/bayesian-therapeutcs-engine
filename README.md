This repository contains a coding framework for building Bayesian network architectures. Coded as a domain agnostic mathematical framework for quantifying and managing multiple sources of uncertainty. XAI-BiO is building on this architectural framework - building an AI system to model complex biological systems and discover therapeutics. We call this AI system the Bayesian Therapeutics Engine ™.
