# Bayesian Therapeutics Engine ™
![my image](Images/BayesianInference.png)
This repository contains a coding framework for building Bayesian network architectures. Coded as a domain agnostic mathematical framework for quantifying and managing multiple sources of uncertainty. XAI-BiO is building on this architectural framework - building an AI system to model complex biological systems and discover therapeutics. We call this AI system the Bayesian Therapeutics Engine ™. 

### Managing Uncertainty 

The power of science to illuminate the workings of the world is based on sound uncertainty management. While we cannot be absolutely sure of the veracity of any statement, we can have varying degrees of confidence in different hypotheses, and update this confidence as new facts emerge. Under the scientific method, such new facts are in turn sought by considering the predictions of competing hypotheses. 

### Integrating Scientific Knowledge

The rate of scientific data generation is higher than ever and increasing rapidly. Drug discovery relies on existing knowledge but also contributes, with new research, to this body. Scientists face challenging tasks of drawing on all available relevant information and producing accurate hypothesis evaluations before investing in a given drug and its testing. An important question is whether to carry out tests on a given proposed drug in light of previous results. 

As with any risk,  good decision-making requires research teams to gauge as accurately as possible the probability that a drug will indeed be viable. When the biological causes of disease are unknown new drugs are usually proposed on the assumption that a given hypothesis is the right one. Even if a hypothesis is true, other factors also affect the likelihood that a drug yields the desired results. Thus, the probability of the testing bearing fruit will be a product of such conditional probabilities.

### Accelerate Scientific Modelling and Experimental Validation

Scientific modelling is challenging. The Bayesian Therapeutics Engine ™ seeks to automate workflows in constructing scientific models. We need better theory to guide experiments: models formulated in a mathematical system, which explain and predict disease biology, and the mechanism of action of therapeutics.
